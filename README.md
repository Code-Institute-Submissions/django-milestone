## UX

```
A very simple presentation of a working webshop, easily attached to a technichal blog for introduce new products to readers.
Its simplicity good for around 50 items easily browsing with category and pagination.

A blog reader when got some new information about a new released electronic product on the market,
usually have to go to an othr website to buy that product. Lints to that website probably working with affiliate systems.

The blog owner with this application of the blog website, can sell products without go to other online webshop.
